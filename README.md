## 👋 Hi, I’m Jiří Eifler

I’m a Python developer in training with a strong passion for technology and AI.  
Currently completing a 7-month Python Developer program, I’m working on my final project along with several personal projects that combine backend development and AI experimentation.  
I’m driven by curiosity, quick learning, and the desire to turn ideas into working solutions.

🛠 I’m currently working on…
	•	1️⃣ 🗒 MyPlanner (Django Web App)
A personal task-management app built with Django and PostgreSQL.
	•	Create and organize tasks into multiple list types (Daily, Weekly, Shopping, Payments, Birthdays & Events, Someday).
	•	Features: tags, priorities, due dates, reminders, optional events, and comments.
	•	Provides both classic HTML views and a REST API for future integrations.
	•	2️⃣ 📄 Automated Invoice Data Extractor
A Python-based automation tool for handling invoices.
	•	Watches a designated folder for incoming PDF files.
	•	Extracts predefined attributes (e.g., name, contract no., email).
	•	Saves results into a structured Excel spreadsheet.
	•	3️⃣ 🤖 Build an AI Agent From Scratch in Python
A hands-on project to design and implement a fully functional AI agent.
	•	Processes information and performs intelligent decision-making.
	•	Explores core AI concepts and autonomous workflows.

📌 All three projects will be completed by August 2025.
