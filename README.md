## 👋 Hi, I’m Jiří Eifler

I’m a Python developer with a strong passion for technology and AI.  
I have completed a 7-month Python Developer program, including several projects (listed below).  
I’m driven by curiosity, quick learning, and the desire to turn ideas into working solutions.

- 🛠 Recently, I have completed…

	- Features: tags, priorities, due dates, reminders, optional events, and comments.
	- Provides both classic HTML views and a REST API for future integrations.
	- The application provides both classic HTML views for everyday use and a REST API for potential integration with other platforms or future mobile/React clients.
