## 👋 Hi, I’m Jiří Eifler

I’m a Python developer in training with a strong passion for technology and Artificial Intelligence.
Currently completing a 7‑month Python Developer program, I’m working on my final project along with several personal projects that combine backend development and AI experimentation. I’m driven by curiosity, quick learning, and the desire to turn ideas into working solutions.

  - 1️⃣ 🌱 Plant Care Tracker (Django Web App)
A web application that allows users to log and track the care of their plants, including watering, fertilizing, and repotting dates. Users can monitor the full care history, track plant growth, and maintain a clear overview of each plant’s needs. Built with Django.

  - 2️⃣ 📄 Automated Invoice Data Extractor
A Python-based automation tool that monitors a designated folder for incoming invoices. When a new file is added, it automatically reads and converts the content to text, extracts predefined attributes, and exports them into a neatly formatted Excel spreadsheet.
  - 3️⃣ 🤖 Build an AI Agent From Scratch in Python
A hands-on project focused on designing and implementing a fully functional AI agent entirely from scratch using Python. The agent leverages AI techniques to process information and execute intelligent decision-making.
