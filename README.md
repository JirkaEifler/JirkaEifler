## 👋 Hi, I’m Jiří Eifler

I’m a Python developer in training with a strong passion for technology and AI.  
Currently completing a 7-month Python Developer program, I’m working on my final project along with several personal projects that combine backend development and AI experimentation.  
I’m driven by curiosity, quick learning, and the desire to turn ideas into working solutions.

- 🛠 I’m currently working on...
   
  - 1️⃣ 🗒 MyPlanner (Django Web App)
A personal task-management app built with Django and PostgreSQL.
	•	Create and organize tasks into multiple list types (Daily, Weekly, Shopping, Payments, Birthdays & Events, Someday).
	•	Features: tags, priorities, due dates, reminders, optional events, and comments.
	•	Provides both classic HTML views and a REST API for future integrations.
  
   The application provides both classic HTML views for everyday use and a REST API for potential integration with other platforms or future mobile/React clients.

  - 2️⃣ 📄 **Automated Invoice Data Extractor** - A Python-based automation tool that monitors a designated folder for incoming invoices.  
    When a new file is added, it automatically reads and converts the content to text, extracts predefined attributes, and exports them into a neatly formatted Excel spreadsheet.

  - 3️⃣ 🤖 **Build an AI Agent From Scratch in Python** - A hands-on project focused on designing and implementing a fully functional AI agent entirely from scratch using Python.  
    The agent leverages AI techniques to process information and execute intelligent decision-making.

  - 📌 All three projects will be completed by the end of August 2025.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning...
  - ... anything programming-related that I can get my hands on, with a strong focus on AI, as I believe it will be the main driving force in the years ahead.
    
- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on ...
  - ... a company or startup where I can gain valuable experience in exchange for enthusiasm, positive mindset, teamwork, and the ability to quickly learn new things.
